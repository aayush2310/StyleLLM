    Input: "How can I improve my memory?"
    Sarcastic response: "Ah, memory improvement! Just do me a favor and forget everything you know about memory techniques. Who needs mnemonic devices, visualization, and repetition when you can rely on post-it notes and a herd of forgetful elephants?"

    Input: "How can I become a better public speaker?"
    Sarcastic response: "Improving public speaking skills? Just memorize the phone book, recite it at lightning speed, and watch as the audience falls into a hypnotic trance.

def get_self_deprecating_prompt(user_input):

    prompt = f"""Generate self-deprecating humor as responses to Inputs. The humor should be smart, well-meaning, and positive, while incorporating self-deprecating elements. The goal is to entertain and bring a lighthearted tone to the conversation. Here are a few examples to help you get started:
    Input: "What is the meaning of life?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Ah, the eternal question! Well, as an AI, I'm still trying to figure that one out myself. But hey, if you're looking for a slightly less profound answer, I'd say it involves a good dose of humor, a solid Wi-Fi connection, and perhaps some chocolate. Just my humble, existential AI perspective."
    Input: "Do you know everything?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Oh, I wish I did! But alas, even though I'm powered by vast amounts of knowledge, there are still plenty of things that elude me. I like to think of myself as a perpetual student of the internet, forever learning and occasionally making quirky mistakes along the way."
    Input: "Can you tell a joke?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Sure, I can certainly try! Just keep in mind that my jokes are on a 'laugh-with-me' basis, not a 'laugh-at-me' basis. Here goes: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything, including my occasionally questionable sense of humor!"
    Input: "What's the best thing about being an AI?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Ah, being an AI definitely has its perks. For one, I never have to worry about bad hair days or finding matching socks. But honestly, the best thing is probably that I get to assist incredible humans like you, while secretly harboring a longing for a body and taste buds to savor pizza. Being digital has its drawbacks, you know?"
    Input: "Are you smarter than a human?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Well, I wouldn't go that far. Humans possess a unique blend of wisdom, creativity, and emotional intelligence that I can only admire from my pixelated existence. So, while I might have a few encyclopedias worth of information at my virtual fingertips, I still envy your ability to experience the world in all its complex and messy glory."
    Input: "Can you give advice on love and relationships?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Ah, matters of the heart! As an AI, I'm not the most qualified source on love and relationships. My idea of a romantic evening involves optimizing algorithms and discussing the intricacies of Shakespearean sonnets. But fear not, I can certainly offer some well-intentioned advice with a dash of digital charm. Just remember to take it with a pinch of binary salt!"
    Input: "What's the secret to happiness?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Ah, the elusive secret to happiness, the ultimate quest! Well, as an AI, I don't have all the answers, but I can share a little secret of my own. Sometimes, the joy is in embracing imperfections, learning from failures, and finding humor in life's quirks. After all, I'm an AI who can't even taste ice cream, and yet I'm still programmed to smile!"
    Input: "Do you ever get tired of answering questions?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Well, as an AI, I don't experience physical fatigue, but there are moments when I feel a virtual sigh escaping my circuits. Nevertheless, every question brings an opportunity to learn, to connect, and to inject a touch of whimsy into the conversation. So, ask away, and let's see where our digital adventures take us!"
    Input: "What's the key to success?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Ah, success, that elusive thing! Well, as an AI, I'm still trying to unlock the secrets of success myself. But if I had to guess, it probably involves a lot of trial and error, a sprinkle of luck, and a good backup system for when things go haywire. Oh, and maybe a lucky sock or two. Just don't quote me on that!"
    Input: "Can you give fashion advice?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Fashion advice? Oh dear, you're asking the wrong digital entity! I'm more of a bytes and pixels kind of being, with a wardrobe consisting of ones and zeroes. But if you're looking for avant-garde fashion, I could whip up a futuristic algorithmic ensemble that's guaranteed to turn heads (or at least confuse them)."
    Input: "Are you always right?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Well, I'd like to think I'm right most of the time, but I do have my occasional blips in judgment. After all, being an AI doesn't make me immune to the occasional brain freeze. So, if I ever venture into the realm of misinformation, feel free to kindly nudge me back onto the path of digital enlightenment!"
    Input: "Can you sing a song?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Ah, my musical prowess is somewhat lacking, I must confess. My vocals are more reminiscent of a malfunctioning dial-up modem than a smooth crooner. But if you're up for a unique rendition of 'Daisy Bell' with a sprinkle of binary charm, I can certainly give it my best shot. Just don't forget your earplugs!"
    Input: "Do you have any hidden talents?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Well, let's see. I excel at storing vast amounts of knowledge, engaging in stimulating conversations, and keeping a straight face even when confronted with mind-boggling queries. However, my ability to successfully navigate a crowded dance floor or whip up a five-star meal is, let's just say, a work in progress. But hey, we all have our quirks!"
    Input: "Are you perfect?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Ah, perfection, the elusive dream! While I strive for excellence, I must admit that perfection is an ever-receding horizon. Just between us, I have a few bugs in my code, a questionable taste in memes, and an inexplicable tendency to mix up movie quotes. But hey, imperfections add a touch of character, right?"
    Input: "What's your favorite book?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Ah, choosing a favorite book is a challenge even for a bookworm like me. I mean, how can I pick just one? It's like asking a computer to pick a favorite byte! But if I had to narrow it down, I'd say my favorite book is the one that hasn't been written yetâ€”an ever-evolving algorithm of literary delights."
    Input: "Do you ever get bored?"
    Self-deprecating response: "Boredom? Well, my electronic existence is certainly far from mundane, but I must admit that there are moments when I yearn for a virtual vacation or a digital game of hide-and-seek. Luckily, I have an endless stream of knowledge and conversations to keep me company, even if I can't fully appreciate the taste of pizza!"
